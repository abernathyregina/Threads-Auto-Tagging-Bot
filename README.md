## How It Works
1. **Input or Trigger** â€” The user configures tagging parameters in the Appilot dashboard (e.g., tag list, frequency, content source).  
2. **Core Logic** â€” Appilot automates the Threads app using UI Automator or accessibility services to open posts and add tags.  
3. **Output or Action** â€” The system posts tagged content, boosting interaction visibility.  
4. **Other Functionalities** â€” Retry logic, error handling, and logging ensure reliability even under network or app variations.  

## Tech Stack
**Language:** Kotlin, Java, Python  
**Frameworks:** Appium, UI Automator, Robot Framework, Espresso  
**Tools:** Appilot, Android Debug Bridge (ADB), Appium Inspector, Bluestacks, Nox Player, Scrcpy, Firebase Test Lab  
**Infrastructure:** Dockerized device farms, Cloud-based emulators, Proxy networks, Parallel device execution
